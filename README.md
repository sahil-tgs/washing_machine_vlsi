## Overview
The Automatic Washing Machine controller is designed to control the various functionalities of a washing machine. It operates within distinct states, including Check_Door, Fill_Water, Add_Detergent, Drain_Water, and Spin. The controller consists of two main blocks: a Finite-State Machine (FSM) block and a Timer block.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of Verilog HDL in the development of an Automatic Washing Machine controller. By implementing the controller using an FSM model, we have showcased the versatility of Verilog HDL in designing complex control systems.
